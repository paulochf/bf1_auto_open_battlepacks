6. Click on Apply Video Settings and confirm you want to keep the settings.
7. Go back to the Main Menu and enter the Battlepacks screen.
8. Press F6 to open the script screen.
9. Fill in the amount of times the script will run. Put a number greater than the Battlepacks you have.
10. Go for a walk.

Now you can scrap things for coins:
    - at the Inventory screen (Battlepacks -> Inventory):
        - scrap the duplicate skins using the button at the left;
        - scrap the Squad XP Boost: select it at the left, then you should see the scrap button at the right;
    - at the Puzzles screen (Battlepacks -> Puzzles):
        - enter each weapon you've built already and scrap its sparing puzzles pieces, if any;
