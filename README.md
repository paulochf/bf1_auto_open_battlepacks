**{- ATTENTION! READ CAREFULLY! -}**

You *can* use the Seller to sell duplicated skins, but **you shouldn't**. It's **EASIER** to use the "Scrap Duplicates" button ingame.

**IF** you can't sell all duplicates using the "Scrap Duplicates (#)" button at the left bar in the Inventory screen, choose the skin you want to sell and run the script **_for less than the number you have_**.

Example: If the game shows you have 6 units (with an x6 in the icon's bottom-left corner), **RUN THE SCRIPT FOR 5 TIMES, AT MOST!**. The 6th time will make you run out of the chosen skin!
